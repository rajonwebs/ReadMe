1) Custom Subdomains

For each custom subdomain use domains:add in the Terminal.

heroku domains:add www.example.com
2) Subdomain DNS

Go to the domain's DNS manager and configure it with a CNAME record pointing the subdomain to your herokuapp.com hostname.

Record	Name	Target
CNAME	www	example.herokuapp.com
To check that this worked correctly run host www.example.com

3) URL Forwarding

This will work to have www.example.com forward to www.example.herokuapp.com, but it won't work if a user types example.com into the browser.

To get this to work, go to the GoDaddy domain information and set forwarding to www.example.com.
==============================================================
There are 2 steps you need to perform,

Add the custom domains addon and add the domain your going to use, eg www.mywebsite.com to your application
Go to your domain registrar control panel and set www.mywebsite.com to be a CNAME entry to yourapp.herokuapp.com assuming you are using the CEDAR stack.
There is a third step if you want to use a naked domain, eg mywebsite.com when you would have to add the IP addresses of the Heroku load balancers to your DNS for mywebsite.com

At a guess you've missed out the first step perhaps?

UPDATE: Following the announcement of Bamboo's EOL proxy.heroku.com being retired (September 2014) for Bamboo applications so these should also now use the yourapp.herokuapp.com mapping now as well.
