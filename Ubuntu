==================DELETING =====================
rm -rf lampp      #It deletes all files and folders contained in the lampp directory.
rm -R -i lampp    # SAFER VERSION - Adding -i makes it a little safer, because it will prompt you on every deletion. However, if you are deleting many files this is not going to be very practical.

There are lots of ways to delete a directory through CLI mode. It depends on which way you are comfortable with.

rm -rvf /path/to/directory

-r = remove directories and their contents recursively
-v = explain what is being done
-f = ignore nonexistent files, never prompt
